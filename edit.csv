Detection of a damaged page header normally causes PostgreSQL to report an error, aborting the current transaction.

This behavior will destroy data, namely all the rows on the damaged page.","Used for salvaging data from a known-bad database.  You should always make a binary backup before using this option, and it should not be used while users are allowed to connect.  After damaged pages are erased, other kinds of data intergrity errors may persist (like broken PKs and FKs).  ZDP should generally be used to get your DB to a stage where the data can be dumped and loaded into a new database.",,
