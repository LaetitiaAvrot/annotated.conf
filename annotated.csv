File Locations,,config_file,string,ConfigDir/postgresql.conf,default,,postmaster,Sets the server's main configuration file.,"Can only be changed via command-line switch for obvious reasons.  Useful primarily for testing different configuration options, or for automated restart with different configuration options."
File Locations,,data_directory,string,ConfigDir,default,,postmaster,Sets the server's data directory.,"Supports the ability to distribute files according to sysadmin or operating system defined schemes, or for launching multiple restart instances using the same binaries.  Most of the time, it's better to use configuration options to define these locations so that all PostgreSQL binaries default to the correct paths."
File Locations,,external_pid_file,string,None,default,,postmaster,Writes the postmaster PID to the specified file.,Creates an extra copy of the process ID.  Used for server administration tools which need a copy of the process ID in a specific directory.

Connections and Authentication,Security and Authentication,db_user_namespace,bool,off,do not use,,sighup,Enables per-database user names.,"This setting is a hack to work around the lack of per-database users in PostgreSQL.  Unless you desperately need it, avoid this setting as it will eventually be replaced by something more maintainable."
Connections and Authentication,Security and Authentication,krb_caseins_users,bool,off,varies,,sighup,Sets whether Kerberos and GSSAPI user names should be treated as case-insensitive.,"Speak with your sysadmin or network security about how to set the various kerberos settings to match your local kerberos setup.  Kerberos support must be compiled in to PostgreSQL, and set in pg_hba.conf."
Connections and Authentication,Security and Authentication,krb_server_keyfile,string,,varies,,sighup,Sets the location of the Kerberos server key file.,
Connections and Authentication,Security and Authentication,password_encryption,bool,on,on,"md5,scram-sha-256",user,Encrypt passwords.,There is no good reason for this to be set to “off”.
Connections and Authentication,Security and Authentication,ssl,bool,off,on,,sighup,Enables SSL connections.,"One of several different settings to turn on SSL connections for PostgreSQL.  SSL is a very good idea for highly secure setups.  In addition, you must compile in SSL support and set SSL connections in pg_hba.conf, as well as configuring SSL itself."
Connections and Authentication,Security and Authentication,ssl_ca_file,,,config,,sighup,Location of the SSL certificate authority file.,"You should always use SSL connections if you can.  However, this does require setting up SSL."
Connections and Authentication,Security and Authentication,ssl_cert_file,,server.crt,config,,sighup,Location of the SSL server certificate file.,"According to your SSL configuration, which maybe provided by your installer."
Connections and Authentication,Security and Authentication,ssl_ciphers,string,HIGH:MEDIUM:+3DES:!aNULL,default,,sighup,Sets the list of allowed SSL ciphers.,"Allows DBAs to require “strong enough” or preset ciphers for SSL connections.

Connections and Authentication,Connection Settings,max_connections,integer,100,under 1000,1 to 262143,postmaster,Sets the maximum number of concurrent connections.,"Should be set to the maximum number of connections which you expect to need at peak load.  Note that each connection uses shared_buffer memory, as well as additional non-shared memory, so be careful not to run the system out of memory.  In general, if you need more than 200 connections, you should probably be making more use of connection pooling."
Connections and Authentication,Connection Settings,port,integer,5432,default,1 to 65535,postmaster,Sets the TCP port the server listens on.,"Alternate ports are primarily useful for running several versions, or instances, of PostgreSQL on one machine.  However, if you're using an alternate port to support several versions, it's often better to compile in the port number."
Connections and Authentication,Connection Settings,superuser_reserved_connections,integer,3,default,0 to 262143,postmaster,Sets the number of connection slots reserved for superusers.,"You should have at least one superuser connection open for troubleshooting at all times.  So if you run more than two concurrent regular administrative tasks, you'll need more reserved connections.  Note that this number is taken from max_connections, not in addition to it."
Connections and Authentication,Connection Settings,unix_socket_directories,string,/tmp,change,,postmaster,Sets the directories where Unix-domain sockets will be created.,"Change to a more secure directory, which many installers do for you."
Connections and Authentication,Connection Settings,unix_socket_group,string,NULL,postgres,,postmaster,Sets the owning group of the Unix-domain socket.,

Connections and Authentication,Connection Persistence,authentication_timeout,time,60,decrease,1s to 600s,sighup,Sets the maximum allowed time to complete client authentication.,"For production databases, it's important that this value be synchronized with the timeout on the application server side.  Most web applications will want a shorter timeout, like 20s."
Connections and Authentication,Connection Persistence,tcp_keepalives_count,integer,0,default,0 to 2147483647,user,Maximum number of TCP keepalive retransmits.,"The three tcp_keepalive settings help manage a system which tends to have ""undead"" connection/query processes.  For systems which support them, you can regulate checking that connections are still ""live"" end-to-end to kill them off.  Not needed if you're not having a problem.  Should be synchronized with the new TCP keepalive support in libpq on the client side."
Connections and Authentication,Connection Persistence,tcp_keepalives_idle,integer,0,default,0s to 2147483647s,user,Time between issuing TCP keepalives.,

Resource Usage,CPU,max_worker_processes,integer,8,increase,0 to 262143,postmaster,Maximum number of concurrent worker processes.,"Increase to max_parallel_workers + other workers, such as workers for logical replication and custom background workers.  Not more than your number of cores, though."
Resource Usage,Memory,dynamic_shared_memory_type,ENUM,auto-detect,default,"posix,sysv,mmap,none",postmaster,Selects the dynamic shared memory implementation used.,
Resource Usage,Memory,huge_pages,ENUM,try,default,"off,on,try",postmaster,Use of huge pages on Linux.,"However, for small systems (< 2GB of RAM) may be beneficial to set to “off”."
Resource Usage,Memory,max_prepared_transactions,integer,5,0 or max_connections,0 to 262143,postmaster,Sets the maximum number of simultaneously prepared transactions.,"Most applications do not use XA prepared transactions, so should set this parameter to 0.  If you do require prepared transactions, you should set this equal to max_connections to avoid blocking.  May require increasing kernel memory parameters."
Resource Usage,Memory,shared_buffers,memory,varies 512kB to 8MB,AvRAM / 4,168kB to 10737418238kB,postmaster,Sets the number of shared memory buffers used by the server.,"A memory quantity defining PostgreSQL's ""dedicated"" RAM, which is used for connection control, active operations, and more.  However, since PostgreSQL also needs free RAM for file system buffers, sorts and maintenance operations, it is not advisable to set shared_buffers to a majority of RAM.   Note that increasing shared_buffers often requires you to increase some  system kernel parameters, most notably SHMMAX and SHMALL.  See  Operating System Environment: Managing Kernel Resources in the PostgreSQL documentation for more details.  Also note that shared_buffers over 2GB is  only supported on 64-bit systems."
Resource Usage,Memory,temp_buffers,memory,8MB,default,1008kB to 10737418238kB,user,Sets the maximum number of temporary buffers used by each session.,"Currently used only for holding temporary tables in memory.  If your application requires heavy use of temporary tables (many proprietary reporting engines do) then you might want to increase this substantially.  However, be careful because this is non-shared RAM which is allocated per session.  Otherwise, the default is fine."
Resource Usage,Memory,work_mem,integer,1MB,( AvRAM / max_connections ) OR ( AvRAM / 2 * max_connections ),64kB to 2147483647kB,user,Sets the maximum memory to be used for query workspaces.,"Sets the limit for the amount of non-shared RAM available for each query operation, including sorts and hashes.  This limit acts as a primitive resource control, preventing the server from going into swap due to overallocation.  Note that this is non-shared RAM per operation, which means large complex queries can use multple times this amount.  Also, work_mem is allocated by powers of two, so round to the nearest binary step.  The second formula is for reporting and DW servers which run a lot of complex queries."
Resource Usage,Kernel Resources,max_files_per_process,integer,1000,default,25 to 2147483647,postmaster,Sets the maximum number of simultaneously open files for each server process.,"If you have a large database with many partitioned tables, you may want to increase this.  Note that you will probably have to increase ulimits for the postgres user or system as well."
Resource Usage,Kernel Resources,max_stack_depth,memory,2MB,default,100kB to 2147483647kB,superuser,"Sets the maximum stack depth, in kilobytes.",Increase this if you have experienced the relevant error.
Resource Usage,Kernel Resources,shared_preload_libraries,string,,default,,postmaster,Lists shared libraries to preload into server.,"Primarily used for custom C libraries (data types, stored procedures) which you expect your application to use heavily.  Trades memory overhead for these libraries against load time, so really should only be used for libraries you expect most queries to require."
Resource Usage,Disk,temp_file_limit,memory,-1 (disabled),10GB,-1kB to 2147483647kB,superuser,Limits the total size of all temporary files used by each process.,"… or something which is bigger than your largest possible sort, but not big enough to run you out of disk space."

WAL and Checkpoints,Settings,wal_compression,bool,off,on,,superuser,Compresses full-page writes written in WAL file.,… unless your storage is less constrained than your CPU.
WAL and Checkpoints,Settings,wal_log_hints,,off,off,,postmaster,"Writes full pages to WAL when first modified after a checkpoint, even for a non-critical modifications.",
WAL and Checkpoints,Archiving,archive_command,string,(disabled),varies,,sighup,Sets the shell command that will be called to archive a WAL file.,All of the Archiving settings are part of a Point In Time Recovery or Warm Standby configuration.  Please see the Backup and Restore section for more information.
WAL and Checkpoints,Archiving,archive_mode,bool,off,varies,"always,on,off",postmaster,Allows archiving of WAL files using archive_command.,"Requires a restart to change, so if you want to turn archiving on and off, set this to 'on' and change archive_command instead.  Even better, set archive_command to a script which can be disabled by trigger or ENV variable."
WAL and Checkpoints,Archiving,archive_timeout,integer,0,varies,0s to 1073741823s,sighup,Forces a switch to the next WAL file if a new file has not been started within N seconds.,Dependant on your tradeoff between disk space and letting the standby get behind.
WAL and Checkpoints,Memory,wal_buffers,memory,-1 auto,default,-18kB to 2621438kB,postmaster,Sets the number of disk-page buffers in shared memory for WAL.,"On very busy, high-core machines it can be useful to raise this to as much as 128MB."
WAL and Checkpoints,Synch to Disk,backend_flush_after,memory,0,default,08kB to 2568kB,user,Number of pages after which previously performed writes are flushed to disk.,Unless you have time to tune memory flushing behavior and test for improvements/regressions
WAL and Checkpoints,Synch to Disk,fsync,bool,on,on,,sighup,Forces synchronization of updates to disk.,"Never turn off unless your data is entirely disposable.  Setting fsync=off is the equivalent of saying “I don't care about my data, I can recreate the database from scratch if I have to.”  If synch activity is a performance concern, see synchronous_commit."
WAL and Checkpoints,Synch to Disk,full_page_writes,bool,on,on,,sighup,Writes full pages to WAL when first modified after a checkpoint.,"This is PostgreSQL's triple-check on transaction log integrity.  Leave it on unless you have enough in-depth knowledge of your filesystem and hardware to be certain that torn page writes of log segments are completely prevented.  Solaris/ZFS users claim to be able to turn this off, but that has not been destruction-tested."
WAL and Checkpoints,Synch to Disk,synchronous_commit,bool,on,on,"local,remote_write,remote_apply,on,off",user,Sets the current transaction's synchronization level.,"If data integrity is less important to you than response times (for example, if you are running a social networking application or processing logs) you can turn this off, making your transaction logs asynchronous.  This can result in up to wal_buffers or wal_writer_delay * 2 worth of data in an unexpected shutdown, but your database will not be corrupted.  Note that you can also set this on a per-session basis, allowing you to mix “lossy” and “safe” transactions, which is a better approach for most applications."
WAL and Checkpoints,Synch to Disk,wal_sync_method,string,OS-dependent,default,"fsync,fdatasync,open_sync,open_datasync",sighup,Selects the method used for forcing WAL updates to disk.,"On install, PostgreSQL figures out the best method for your OS.  It's pretty good at this point; don't change the default.  Note that the value of ""fsync"" shown in your postgresql.conf file is not necessarily the setting the server is using; try SHOW instead."
WAL and Checkpoints,Synch to Disk,wal_writer_delay,integer,200,default,1ms to 10000ms,sighup,Time between WAL flushes performed in the WAL writer.,"Defines the maximum data (in time) that can be lost if synchronous_commit=off and the database shuts down.  Because of long transactions, actual data lost can be up to twice this time.  Has no effect if synchronous_commit=on.  If you are going to turn synchronous_commit=off server-wide, you should probably lower this to prevent too much data loss."
WAL and Checkpoints,Synch to Disk,wal_writer_flush_after,memory,1MB,default,08kB to 21474836478kB,sighup,Amount of WAL written out by WAL writer that triggers a flush.,
WAL and Checkpoints,Commit Settings,commit_delay,integer,0,0,0 to 100000,superuser,Sets the delay in microseconds between transaction commit and flushing WAL to disk.,A primitive form of group commit without asynchronicity.  Performance testing of this is very mixed; only set to non-zero if you have time to test the specific performance impact on your workload.  Reasonable values are 200 to 1000.
WAL and Checkpoints,Commit Settings,commit_siblings,integer,5,1,0 to 1000,user,Sets the minimum concurrent open transactions before performing commit_delay.,See commit_delay.  Reasonable values are 3 to 8
WAL and Checkpoints,Checkpoints,checkpoint_completion_target,real,1,default,0 to 1,sighup,"Time spent flushing dirty buffers during checkpoint, as fraction of checkpoint interval.",Defines the fraction of one checkpoint_interval over which to spread checkpoints. The default value works for most users.

WAL and Checkpoints,Checkpoints,checkpoint_timeout,integer,300,default,30s to 86400s,sighup,Sets the maximum time between automatic WAL checkpoints.,"If you do really large ETL batches, you may want to increase this setting to the maximum length of a batch run."
WAL and Checkpoints,Checkpoints,checkpoint_warning,integer,30,default,0s to 2147483647s,sighup,Enables warnings if checkpoint segments are filled more frequently than this.,
WAL and Checkpoints,Background Writer,bgwriter_delay,time,200,default,10ms to 10000ms,sighup,Background writer sleep time between rounds.,"Thanks to bgwriter autotuning, it should no longer be necessary for most users to touch the bgwriter settings.  Only modify these if you have a demonstrated issue shown by checkpoint spikes and monitoring pg_stat_bgwriter.  Laptop PostgreSQL users may want to increase bgwriter_delay to 60s to decrease I/O activity, since it is no longer possible to turn the bgwriter off."
WAL and Checkpoints,Background Writer,bgwriter_flush_after,memory,512kB,default,08kB to 2568kB,sighup,Number of pages after which previously performed writes are flushed to disk.,Unless you have time to tune memory flushing behavior and test for improvements/regressions

Replication,Master Options,max_wal_senders,integer,10,"Max replicas you expect to have, doubled",0 to 262143,postmaster,Sets the maximum number of simultaneously running WAL sender processes.,"If you are replicating, you want to set this to the maximum number of standby servers you might possibly have.  Performance impact when set above zero, but no additional penalty for setting it higher."
Replication,Master Options,synchronous_standby_names,string,NULL,default,,sighup,Number of synchronous standbys and list of names of potential synchronous ones.,"Special, see syntax for sync standby config.  Don't get into this if you're not sure what you're doing."

Replication,Master Options,vacuum_defer_cleanup_age,integer,0,0,0 to 1000000,sighup,"Number of transactions by which VACUUM and HOT cleanup should be deferred, if any.",No longer effective thanks to hot_standby_feedback.
Replication,Master Options,wal_keep_segments,integer,0,8 to 128,0 to 2147483647,sighup,Sets the number of WAL files held for standby servers.,"… if using replication.  Minimum number of WAL log segments to keep in order to support re-synchronizing streaming standby servers which have fallen behind or for an initial sync, a good rule of thumb is 4, or however many segments you go through in 30s, whichever is higher. This is in addition to max_wal_size, so make sure you have enough disk space.  Not required if you are archiving logs."
Replication,Master Options,wal_level,enum,replica,replica or logical,"minimal,replica,logical",postmaster,Set the level of information written to the WAL.,"Level replica is required for binary replication, and level logical is required for logical replication.  This is a setting because raising the level adds more writes to the WAL, so if you’re not doing replication or archiving at all, set it to minimal."
Replication,Master Options,wal_sender_timeout,time,60sec,default,0ms to 2147483647ms,sighup,Sets the maximum time to wait for WAL replication.,
Replication,Standby Options,hot_standby,bool,on,on,,postmaster,Allows connections and queries during recovery.,"Set to “on”, unless you want to specifically prohibit people from running queries on a standby server."
Replication,Standby Options,hot_standby_feedback,bool,off,on,,sighup,Allows feedback from a hot standby to the primary that will avoid query conflicts.,Helps avoid query cancel on the replicas in most cases.  Turn it off for a replica which does long-running reports and is allowed to lag.

Query Tuning,Planner Cost Constants,effective_cache_size,integer,65536,( AvRAM * 0.75 ),18kB to 21474836478kB,user,Sets the planner's assumption about the size of the disk cache.,"Tells the PostgreSQL query planner how much RAM is estimated to be available for caching data, in both shared_buffers and in the filesystem cache. This setting just helps the planner make good cost estimates; it does not actually allocate the memory."
Query Tuning,Planner Cost Constants,random_page_cost,real,4,default,0 to 1.79769e+308,user,Sets the planner's estimate of the cost of a nonsequentially fetched disk page.,"Sets the ratio of seek to scan time for your database storage.  Should not be altered unless you're using special storage (SSDs, high end SANs, etc.) where seek/scan ratios are actually different.  If you need the database to favor indexes more, tune effective_cache_size and some of the cpu_* costs instead."
Query Tuning,Planner Cost Constants,seq_page_cost,real,1,default,0 to 1.79769e+308,user,Sets the planner's estimate of the cost of a sequentially fetched disk page.,The main reason to modify seq_page_cost is to try to get planner costs to more-or-less indicate execution times in milleseconds.  All other costs change relative to this cost automatically.

Reporting and Logging,Where to Log,log_destination,string,csvlog,varies,,sighup,Sets the destination for server log output.,"Your choice of log destination depends on your system administration plans and the status of your server.  “syslog” or “eventlog” (Windows) are good choices for most development servers, because they can support centralized log monitors.  For development and testing, however, “csvlog” is probably the most useful, as it allows you to run queries against the log contents."
Reporting and Logging,Where to Log,log_directory,string,pg_log,varies,,sighup,Sets the destination directory for log files.,"If you are having PostgreSQL keep its own activity logs on a production server, it's probably a good idea to locate them on separate storage from the database and transaction log."
